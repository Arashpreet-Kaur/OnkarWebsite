    <p><b>The Golden Temple</b>, also known as <b>Sri Harmandir Sahib</b>, is one of the most revered spiritual sites in Sikhism. 
        Located in the city of Amritsar, in the Indian state of Punjab,
         it is a symbol of human brotherhood and equality, embodying the Sikh principles of humility and service.</p><br>

    <p><b>Langar:</b>One of the most important practices at the Golden Temple is the Langar, a community
         kitchen that serves free meals to all visitors, regardless of caste, creed, or religion.
